## üìù Project Description
The project aims to provide valuable insights and strategic information to optimize operations and boost the company's sales performance.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Data Source:
Report generated in the Sales System used by Bodogami - LinkedGourmet

## üìå Methodology and Analysis of Patterns and Trends
Bodogami already has consistent historical sales data, which I used as the basis for the sales analysis. I used the report generated in the LinkedGourmet sales system, which includes information such as product name, unit price, quantity sold and date of sale. In addition, I aggregated cost information for each product from another data source. Then the data were organized, classified and presented in order to facilitate the understanding and analysis of the sales patterns of each product.

Using data analysis and visualization techniques, the initial objective was to present the Pareto relationship between products and revenue, as well as a matrix inspired by the BCG matrix to analyze the participation of each product in revenue and its individual margin. These insights will allow Restaurante Bodogami to make informed decisions to improve inventory management, adjust the menu according to customer preferences, identify potential products and direct marketing actions.

##  üíª Deliveries:
As a final result of the project, two data visualization panels were delivered in Power BI, containing information on Bodogami's bar and kitchen products. These dashboards provide a clear, actionable view into product performance, allowing us to identify growth opportunities and inform strategic decisions to drive our establishment's success.

##  üéØ Conclusion:
The analysis of sales of products from the bar and kitchen at Restaurante Bodogami is an essential strategy to improve the performance and success of the establishment. I hope this project will provide valuable results, allowing the restaurant to improve its profitability, optimize inventory, adjust the menu according to customers' preferences, increase customer satisfaction and drive business growth.

I would like to thank Bodogami for the opportunity to work with their data and for the positive reception of the results achieved.
